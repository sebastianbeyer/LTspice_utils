This is a simple potentiometer part for LTspice.
There are lin and log. Edit (total) resistance and rotation position in the
right click menu. I recommend checking the "visible" checkbox next to the PARAM
field, so you see the state in your schematic.
Turn direction in indicated by the arrow, this points in the clockwise turn
direction.

AND PLEASE DOUBLE CHECK IF I GOT THE DIRECTION RIGHT!! ;-)
